      <description>Introduction  P2JS physics engine. Today I would use Box2D as it supports CCD which was a HUGE problem, there was a lot of tunneling on weak system. Created a custom state machine to manage the state of all entities Created a custom action system to trigger different predefined actions like light on, ball reset, start mission, trigger sound and so on. A zone system so that only 1&amp;frasl;4 of the involved table physics is active at one moment.</description>
